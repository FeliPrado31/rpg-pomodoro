# RPG Pomodoro - Future Gamification Ideas

This document outlines potential gamification features that could be added to the Pomodoro RPG application after the MVP is complete.

## 1. Achievement System

Implement a system of achievements to reward users for specific milestones and behaviors:

- **Early Bird**: Complete 3 Pomodoros before noon
- **Night Owl**: Complete 3 Pomodoros after 8 PM
- **Consistent**: Complete at least 1 Pomodoro for 5 consecutive days
- **Marathon**: Complete 10 Pomodoros in a single day
- **Level Milestone**: Reach level 5, 10, 25, etc.
- **Pomodoro Milestone**: Complete 50, 100, 500 Pomodoros total

Each achievement could:
- Display a badge or icon in an "Achievements" section
- Provide a one-time XP bonus
- Unlock cosmetic rewards (see below)

## 2. Character Customization & Cosmetic Rewards

Allow users to customize their character and unlock cosmetic items as they progress:

- **Character Classes**: Choose between Warrior, Mage, Rogue, etc., each with unique visual styles
- **Timer Themes**: Unlock different visual themes for the timer (fantasy, sci-fi, minimalist)
- **Sound Packs**: Different notification sounds for completing sessions (fanfare, magical chime, victory sound)
- **Backgrounds**: Different background images or colors for the app
- **Avatars**: Unlockable character portraits that evolve as the user levels up

These cosmetic rewards would be tied to level milestones or specific achievements.

## 3. Daily Quests & Challenges

Implement a system of rotating daily and weekly challenges:

- **Daily Quests**: 
  - Complete 4 Pomodoros today
  - Complete 2 Pomodoros before noon
  - Take all your scheduled breaks properly

- **Weekly Challenges**:
  - Complete 20 Pomodoros this week
  - Maintain a 3-day streak of completing your daily quest
  - Complete Pomodoros on 5 different days this week

Completing quests and challenges would reward bonus XP and contribute to special achievements.

## 4. Energy & Stamina System

Implement an energy/stamina mechanic to encourage healthy work patterns:

- **Energy Bar**: Depletes slightly with each completed Pomodoro
- **Break Restoration**: Taking proper breaks restores energy
- **Energy Effects**: 
  - High energy (80-100%): Bonus XP per Pomodoro
  - Medium energy (40-79%): Normal XP
  - Low energy (0-39%): Reduced XP gain
  
- **Rest Day Bonus**: Taking a full day off after 6 days of activity provides an "Energized" status effect that gives bonus XP for the next day

This system would encourage users to take proper breaks and avoid burnout while still maintaining productivity.

## Implementation Priority

When implementing these features after the MVP, the suggested order would be:

1. Achievement System (relatively simple to implement, provides immediate gratification)
2. Daily Quests & Challenges (adds variety and daily engagement)
3. Character Customization & Cosmetic Rewards (builds on achievements as unlock mechanism)
4. Energy & Stamina System (more complex, but encourages healthy work habits)

Each feature should be implemented incrementally, with the simplest version first, then expanded based on user feedback.
